# Corallorhiza_tRNAs

## Summary

Analysis of fungal-derived mitochondrial tRNAs in the orchid *Corallorhiza maculata* based on MSR-seq, rRNA-depleted RNA-seq, and genomic DNA sequencing.

The main workflow for read processing, mapping, and classification of tRNAs is described in the CCA_mapping_runs directory. The other directories are for specific analyses and plot generation.

## Raw Data Availability

Raw sequencing data can be found on NCBI SRA (BioProject to be posted soon).

## Reference

This study will be reported in a forthcoming preprint.
